# What is Fleetfolio?

Fleetfolio is a next-generation infrastructure assurance platform built on
**surveilr**. It helps organizations achieve continuous compliance, security,
and operational reliability by bridging the gap between **declared
expectations** and **real-world discovery**.

Unlike traditional asset management tools that simply list discovered assets,
Fleetfolio takes a proactive approach by defining what assets _should_ exist and
verifying them against actual assets found using osQuery Management Server (MS).

## Core Components

- **EAA (Enterprise Asset Assurance)**: Responsible for defining, tracking, and
  validating internal infrastructure assets.
- **TEM (Threat Exposure Management)**: Extends assurance by identifying and
  assessing external exposure risks and attack surfaces.

Together, EAA and TEM provide a complete visibility-to-remediation lifecycle
across infrastructure, applications, and digital assets.

## Why Fleetfolio?

Traditional security tools focus on reactive scanning. Fleetfolio is
**assurance-driven**:

- **Define Intent**: Establish what your infrastructure state should be.
- **Validate Alignment**: Continuously match expectations against multi-source
  discovery.
- **Identify Gaps**: Automatically detect unauthorized assets, shadow IT, and
  misconfigurations.
- **Actionable Intelligence**: Generate structured insights for engineering and
  security teams.
